# Security Review History for PRBMath

| :warning: | Audits are not a guarantee of correctness. Some parts of the code base were modified after they were audited. |
| --------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

The PRBMath library was included in the Sablier codebase audited by the [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/welcome) team during May-June of 2023. Likewise, the [Certora](https://medium.com/certora/problems-in-solidity-fixed-point-libraries-certora-bug-disclosure-987f504daca4) team identified a design flaw in April of 2023. Both issues were timely addressed and are now fixed.

## Cantina Review

In May-June of 2023, the team realized a security review of `Sablier v1.0.0`, which included `prb-math@v3.3.3` in the scope. The report of the review included a finding for the PRBMath library: "3.2.3 PRBMath pow() function can return inconsistent values."

### Issue: PRBMath pow() function can return inconsistent values
