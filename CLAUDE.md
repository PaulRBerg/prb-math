# Development

After you generate new code or update existing code, run `bun run full-check` to verify the code is correct. If there are any errors, run
`bun run full-write` to fix them. If there are issues still, figure out why and fix them.

To install dependencies, run `bun install`, e.g. `bun install some-package` or `bun install -d some-package` to install a dev dependency.
